# Audio Restoration Project

##1. Brief Overview
Audio restoration has become an integral part of digit age and it's tasks range from restoring old recordings to reducing noise in modern audio tracks. An important task of audio restoration algorithms is to remove random clicks in an audio signal which can be done using several methods, namely, AR Method, Cubic Interpolation and Median Filtering. The current project demonstrates two kinds of "click" removal mechanisms:
1. Cubic Interpolation
2. Median Filtering
